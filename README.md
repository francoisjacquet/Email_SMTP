## Description

Send emails using SMTP instead of the default PHP `mail()` function.
Having problems with RosarioSIS not sending emails? Use this SMTP plugin to fix your email deliverability issues.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for sending emails. SMTP helps increase email deliverability by using proper authentication. Just enter your email provider's SMTP server settings to relay emails sent by RosarioSIS.

Get help and settings for Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo in the [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/francoisjacquet/Email_SMTP/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) file.
